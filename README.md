# Leetcoder
This is a repository containing some of my solutions to Leetcode problems. 

Leetcode is a platform useful for brushing up on DataStructure and Algorithm skills through technical interview-standard problems. 

Prior to  the creation of this repository (August 3rd, 2020).  I had solved only 64 Leetcode problems as I was more into other algorithm platforms. See [Solvay](https://github.com/JohnItoo/Solvay)

Now, (8th September, 2020), I have made the repository public to mark a century of Leetcode problems solved.  

Ps: To make this fun, I tried to keep track of my longest streak of consecutive one-time submissions and at this point, it is 7.

# About
I hope to use this as a simple reference and hopefully, others can too.  Solutions are written primarily in C++.  My previous solutions were a mix of Java and C++ but for easier file management and other comforts of the language, I have decided to continue in C++.
Adding solutions in other languages might be done by me or any other contributors interested.

Each file contains Accepted Code to a Leetcode problem whose name is the same file name without the file extension and with white spaces. For instance, `GameofLife.cpp` is the solution to the Leetcode problem `Game of Life`.


## Todo

- Solve some more problems on LC.
- Improve exisiting solutions where possible
- Categorize in a topic-wise manner.

Contributions are very much welcome in form of Pull Requests. If you need to also chat about some solution(s)/ idea(s), kindly feel free to reach out through any means available on [my page](https://johnohue.me/) .
